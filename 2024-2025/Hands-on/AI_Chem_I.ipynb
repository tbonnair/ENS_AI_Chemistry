This is usually achieved through protons and antiprotons collisions experiments in circular or linear accelerators to produce new, or \"exotic\" particles. The low ratio of creation of these new particles ($300$ for $10^{11}$ collisions in the case of the Higgs Boson for instance), and their quick decay into a different particle make their detection a very non-trivial task.\n","\n","In this sense, and given the limited amount of data together with their expensive nature (both in terms of money and time), it is crucial to detect accurately true detections from noisy, background ones.\n","\n","To this end, machine learning algorithms have been shown useful during the past decade and this notebook aims at developping and analysing some ML approaches to solve this binary (or two-class) classification problem.\n","\n","**Reference**: this problem is based on [Baldi et al., Searching for exotic particles in high-energy physics with deep learning, Nature, 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5308)."],"metadata":{"id":"RtFIen19WOu1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# The data\n","\n","In this problem, we consider a subset of the [SUSY](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/279/susy#) dataset (you don't need to download it).
